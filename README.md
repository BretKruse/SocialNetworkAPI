# Social Network API

## Description

This API will help create, update, and delete users and thoughts. It will also give the ability to add and delete friends. Creating and deleting friends will be an option too.

- Use tools like Insomnia to test your routes and models.
- To help create a database for Users and Thoughts.
- It allows a user to create a thought and react to other users thoughts.
- I learned how to create a API using MongoDB and mongoose.

- ``` npm i ```
- Mongoose

You will also need Insomnia to test your routes and models.

## Usage
